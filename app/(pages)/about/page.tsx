            Hi there! I'm Sofia, a Frontend Developer, based in Stockholm,
            Sweden.
          </h2>
          <p className=" pt-8 text-gray-600 text-base">
            Welcome to my world of web wizardry! ðŸš€ Over the last couple of
            years, I've been on an incredible journey through the world of
            JavaScript, with React as my trusty sidekick.
          </p>
          <p className=" pt-8 text-gray-600 text-base">
            My quest for knowledge has led me to master various frameworks and
            wield the magic of CSS to conjure up stunning, responsive web
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-8 text-gray-600 text-base">
            During my 6-month internship at Sverok, I played a pivotal role in
            frontend development and UX/UI design for an Adminpanel and a
            website. The website is anticipated to launch soon and will also
            feature a downloadable game. ðŸŒŸ
          </p>
          <p className="pt-8 text-gray-600 text-base">
            In my bag of tricks, you'll find an array of powerful spells,
            including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, WordPress, SQL
            databases, Cloud Databases, and more! I'm dedicated to delivering
            high-quality web solutions that not only work flawlessly but also
            look great and are easy to use. ðŸŽ¨âœ¨
          </p>
          <p className="pt-8 text-gray-600 text-base">
            Currently, I'm weaving my magic for a company on a project called
            "Wish and Want," where I'm crafting an e-commerce masterpiece within
            the WordPress universe. Stay tuned for some enchanting updates! ðŸ›’ðŸŒŒ
